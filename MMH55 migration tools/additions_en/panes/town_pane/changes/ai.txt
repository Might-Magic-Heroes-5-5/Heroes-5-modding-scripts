MMH55 uses reprogrammed H5_AIProcess31j.exe from Quantomas. New Quick-Combat loss correction scripts will keep the AI challenging even on the largest maps without losing calculation time. There will be a new 64bit exe (MMH55_64.exe) file that can address more memory and fix performance and CTD issues H5 was having on XL maps. MMH5.5 also have easy team settings, the game autodetects if there are more than 2 human players on the map and propose to make teams, if the proposal is refused the players continue as normal. There are new console commands and script functions. In singleplayer a console command can be used on any map to play human vs all AI.
