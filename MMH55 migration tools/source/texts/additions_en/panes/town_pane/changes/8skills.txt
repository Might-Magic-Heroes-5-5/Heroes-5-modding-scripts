MHH5.5 adds an optional 8 secondary skills hero variant that can be used in single and in multi player games. Activate it in "Multiplayer" -> "Hotseat" -> "Standard Mode". Tick the "8 secondary skills" checkbox. In LAN games it must be used by all players. Then start your single player or Multiplayer game. "8 skills" setting is not kept in the save game so activate it every time Heroes 5 exe is started.
