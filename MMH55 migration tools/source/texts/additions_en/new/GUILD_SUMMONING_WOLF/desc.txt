Any Haven native heroes (or Kyrre, Azar specilzations) that have acquired Dragonblood crystals will allow the Magic guilds of all Haven native towns owned by the player to summon Wolf creature group to the garrison every week on day 1. The amount depends on the Dragonblood crystals heroes have collected (A) and the experience level of those heroes (B). Formula = SQRT ( sum(A*B) ) * ( 1+Guild level ) / 8 rounded to the nearest integer. The amount is zero if no crystals are collected. Creature group moral is neutral.
