Hero movement is increased from 2500 to 2750, but now all factions get the same penalty of 25% for every terrain type (except grass = 0%). This was necessary to circumvent hardcoded issue with new classes and balance fortress and academy. Pathfinding penalty reduction is 75%. Stable movement bonus is +500 for first visit and +250 throughout the week. Fountain of Youth and rally flag give +100 additional movement points.
